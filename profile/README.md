# systemwii

welcome ðŸ™‡ i made this organisation to collect up my interdependent wii homebrew repositories. the aim is to create code that can be composed into application projects via git's submodule system, whether Make rules, shared source code files, or libraries. eventually, the project could host standard system utilities too

this meta-project is a development of this [manifesto](https://github.com/modmii/modmii.github.io/issues/23), and i've taken it in the direction of constructing some basic libraries for different apps to use as a first step. it's inspired by [systemd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd) in the sense of providing a common infrastructure for other projects to use, built at a higher-level on top of DevkitPPC/libogc. thanks to @xflak for helping me meet the active dev community and helping to organise contemporary projects

## philosophy

all systemwii projects are communal, meaning there is no owner, and executive decisions should reflect the will of the majority. co-owners are welcome to take care of the repositories (not necessarily maintaining them) and ensure they're available to be developed years down the line for whatever needs may emerge

my intention is for systemwii projects to be maintained openly, with all discussions on their GitHub repositories or in a public Discord's public channels. all code that's added to them should be reviewed, DevkitPPC-compliant (without any weird build steps), and relatively free from technical debt (grassroots rewrites or refactors are preferred to wholesale imports of monoliths)

succession policy: in case i remain the only owner of this organisation and am uncontactable for 3 months, i authorise @xflak and @dacotaco, or any nominated [github successor](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/maintaining-ownership-continuity-of-your-personal-accounts-repositories), to administer the organisation as owner
